# CPP_Compiler_Old
2006 Compiler project from college using C++ to create a C++ complier!

What we are going to do here, is build a compiler for a language like C++ which we'll call it
MiniC++.
The program we make, takes a file written in the previously mentioned language, does what it
does, to check and find out as much as possible all kinds of syntax and semantic errors then if
the program is fine, we generate a target VM machine code file to be executed.
So the process can be expressed as:
